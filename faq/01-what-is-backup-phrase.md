# What is Backup Phrase?

A Backup Phrase is 12 randomly created words (a "personal key" to your wallet) that no one must know. 

When you create a wallet, Plark generates these words and shows them on the screen. 

**It is highly advisable to write them down on a piece of paper because you will not be able to access your wallet if you forget the Backup Phrase.**

It is also of utmost importance to keep the Backup Phase secret. Knowing it, anyone can get access to your wallet. 

Apart from that, if your phone is lost or seriously damaged you will have to use the Backup Phrase to import your wallet into Plark on a different phone.

You can also find your Backup Phrase in Plark following these steps:

1. Tap **Settings** on the main screen.
2. Select **Security**.
3. Tap **View Backup Phrase**.
4. **Enter your PIN** and you will be shown your Backup Phrase.
