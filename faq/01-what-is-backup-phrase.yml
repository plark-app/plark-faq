  A Backup Phrase consists of 12 randomly generated words. The app creates the Backup Phrase for you automatically when you start a new wallet.

  **The** Backup Phrase **is critically important and should be written down and stored in a safe location. Never take screenshots of your** Backup Phrase **as this can be stolen if someone gains access to your device.**
