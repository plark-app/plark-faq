# Why did my cryptocurrency Receive Address change?

Whenever you want to use a Bitcoin-like address (Bitcoin itself, Dash, and Litecoin) to receive a payment, Plark automatically generates a new address for you. 

A new unique address for every transaction provides better security and privacy.  You still can use the old address, although it is not shown on the screen anymore.
