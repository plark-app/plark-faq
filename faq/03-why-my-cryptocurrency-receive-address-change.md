# Why did my crypto currency Receive Address change?

Whenever you receive a payment to a Bitcoin-like (Dash, Litecoin) address shown, a new address is automatically
generated for you. By using a unique address for every transaction, you can increase privacy and security. Old addresses
will still continue to work, even if they are no longer displayed in your app.
