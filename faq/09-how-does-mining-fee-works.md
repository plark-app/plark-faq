# What is mining fee and how does it work?

You pay mining fees every time you send a transaction. These fees are paid to miners and constitute the main part of their earnings. 

How fast you transaction is confirmed depends directly on the mining fee amount. Plark offers Cheap, Average, and Pricy transaction fees.

Cheap fee requires a small commission but there is a risk that your transaction will take long to be confirmed. Bitcoin transactions may even take more than an hour to be confirmed.

Average fee is a sensible middle option, sort of a compromise between the fee you pay and the speed of confirmation.

Pricy fee allows you to get your transaction confirmed within a couple of minutes. Although, it requires you to pay a higher fee.
