# How do I receive crypto currency in my Plark wallet?

If you would like to receive crypto currency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) from someone, you will need to give them your
address. Follow these steps to find your Bitcoin receiving address:

1. On the main screen, tap on desired wallet.
2. At the bottom of the screen, tap **Receive**.
3. Give the sending party your receiving address. There are a few ways to do this:
    - Show them the "Receive Money" screen in your Plark app, and let them scan your QR code.
    - Press the "Share" button under the QR code to send them your address via email or text message.

You can also request for a specific amount by using the Request an Amount option.

**Important:** If Bitcoin is sent to the wrong address, it can not be refunded. When sharing your address, always check
to make sure the address you give out is the same as the one shown under your QR code (comparing the first 5 or 6 digits
is usually sufficient to make sure you are using the correct address).
